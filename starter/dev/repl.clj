;; REPL-driven development
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; If you're new to REPL-driven development, Biff makes it easy to get started: whenever
;; you save a file, your changes will be evaluated. Biff is structured so that in most
;; cases, that's all you'll need to do for your changes to take effect. (See main/refresh
;; below for more details.)
;;
;; The `clj -M:dev dev` command also starts an nREPL server on port 7888, so if you're
;; already familiar with REPL-driven development, you can connect to that with your editor.
;;
;; If you're used to jacking in with your editor first and then starting your app via the
;; REPL, you will need to instead connect your editor to the nREPL server that `clj -M:dev
;; dev` starts. e.g. if you use emacs, instead of running `cider-jack-in`, you would run
;; `cider-connect`. See "Connecting to a Running nREPL Server:"
;; https://docs.cider.mx/cider/basics/up_and_running.html#connect-to-a-running-nrepl-server
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;; This function should only be used from the REPL. Regular application code
;; should receive the system map from the parent Biff component. For example,
;; the use-jetty component merges the system map into incoming Ring requests.
