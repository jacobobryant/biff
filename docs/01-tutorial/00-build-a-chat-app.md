title: Build a chat app
---

To help you learn the ropes, we'll build a discussion application similar to
Discord, Slack, and the like. We'll call it *eelchat*.

In eelchat, users can create communities, each of which has a collection of
channels for text chat. Channels can only be created and deleted by the user
who created the community (i.e. the admin). The admin can also add RSS
subscriptions to channels, so new posts will be displayed.

All the code can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/jacobobryant/eelchat).
