<blockquote>
<p>You can build "easy" on top of "simple", but it's hard to do the reverse.<br>

Biff speeds up web development by providing as much functionality as possible out-of-the-box while making it easy to
swap out, modify, or remove parts as your project grows. It's built with solo developers in mind and is quite
opinionated in its approach to serving that use case.

The goal is to provide the benefits of a web framework without sacrificing the simplicity that makes Clojure great.

## About

Biff is developed by myself, [Jacob O'Bryant](https://tfos.co). I started it while I was a full-time entrepreneur,
working on apps like [Yakread](https://yakread.com/) and [The Sample](https://thesample.ai/) (each of which is built
with Biff and has 10-15k lines of code). See r/Clojure for
[comments about Biff](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/search/?q=biff&restrict_sr=1&type=comment).

Biff is generously sponsored by [JUXT](https://www.juxt.pro/) and
[other individuals](https://github.com/sponsors/jacobobryant/), and it has received
multiple grants from [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/).
