# Biff

A Clojure web framework for solo developers. See [biffweb.com](https://biffweb.com).

## Contributing

First, check out the [content library](https://biffweb.com/docs/library/). Many
contributions to Biff would likely work well as simple how-to guides (e.g. paste some
code + instructions in a gist). If you write something for the content library, open an issue
and I'll add it.

To hack on Biff, either run `bb dev`, or:

1. `cd example`
2. `cp config.edn.TEMPLATE config.edn`
3. `bb dev`

(The example project's deps.edn declares a local dependency on the Biff library
code.)
