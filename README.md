# Biff

A Clojure web framework for solo developers. See [biffweb.com](https://biffweb.com).

## Contributing

First, check out the [content library](https://biffweb.com/docs/library/). Many
contributions to Biff would likely work well as simple how-to guides (e.g. paste some
code + instructions in a gist). If you write something for the content library, open an issue
and I'll add it.

To hack on Biff, either run `bb dev` or `cd starter; clj -M:dev dev`.

(The starter project's deps.edn declares a local dependency on the Biff library
code.)
