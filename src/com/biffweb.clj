                config maps. See below. Required.
  enabled-ids:  An optional set of queue IDs. If non-nil, only queues in the
                set will be created.
  stop-timeout: When shutting down, the number of milliseconds to wait before
                killing any running job consumers. Default 10000.

  Adds a :biff/queues key to the system map which contains a map of queue IDs
  to `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`s. Use (.add queue {...}) to submit a
  job. Jobs are arbitrary maps. Each queue will be consumed by a fixed-size
  thread pool.

  Queue config maps may have the following keys:

  id:        Used as a key in the :biff/queues map. Required.
  consumer:  A one-argument function that will receive a job whenever one is
             available. Receives the system map with :biff/job and :biff/queue
             keys set. biff/merge-context will be called on the system map
             before the consumer is called. Required.
  n-threads: The number of worker threads in the consumer thread pool for this
             queue. Default 1.
  queue-fn:  A zero-arg function that returns a BlockingQueue instance. By
             default, a PriorityBlockingQueue with a custom comparator will be
             used: jobs may include a :biff/priority key, which defaults to 10.

;;;; Authentication

(defn authentication-plugin
  "A Biff plugin that includes backend routes for passwordless authentication.

  Returns a features map that can be included with the rest of your app's
  features.

  There are routes for sending signin links and six-digit signin codes. Either
  method may be used for signing in or signing up. If a new user tries to sign
  in, a user document will be created after they click the link or enter the
  code.

  Signin links usually have a bit less friction, while signin codes are
  resilient to embedded browsers and PWAs on mobile devices. As a default
  recommendation, you can use links for your signup form and codes for your
  signin form.


  INSTRUCTIONS
  ============

  You should provide forms that POST to /auth/send-link and/or /auth/send-code.
  You should also provide pages at the following URLS: /link-sent,
  /verify-link, and /verify-code. See ROUTES for details.

  Your :biff/send-email function must accept the following templates:
   - :signin-link, with parameters :to, :url, and :user-exists.
   - :signin-code, with parameters :to, :code, and :user-exists.


  SCHEMA
  ======

  :biff.auth/code documents are used to store users' signin codes:

  {:biff.auth.code/id :uuid
   :biff.auth/code [:map {:closed true}
                    [:xt/id :biff.auth.code/id]
                    [:biff.auth.code/email :string]
                    [:biff.auth.code/code :string]
                    [:biff.auth.code/created-at inst?]
                    [:biff.auth.code/failed-attempts integer?]]}


  OPTIONS
  =======

  :biff.auth/app-path
  -------------------
  Default: \"/app\"

  Users will be redirected here after they sign in successfully.


  :biff.auth/invalid-link-path
  ----------------------------
  Default: \"/signin\"

  Users will be redirected here if they click on a signin link that is invalid
  or expired.


  :biff.auth/check-state
  ----------------------
  Default: true

  If true and the user opens the signin link on a different device or browser
  from the one the link was requested on, then the user will have to re-enter
  their email address before being authenticated. This helps to prevent people
  from being tricked into signing into someone else's account.


  :biff.auth/new-user-tx
  ----------------------
  Default:

    (fn [ctx email]
      [{:db/doc-type :user
        :db.op/upsert {:user/email email}
        :user/joined-at :db/now}])

  A function that returns a transaction for creating a new user.


  :biff.auth/get-user-id
  ----------------------
  Default:

    (fn [db email]
      (biff/lookup-id db :user/email email)))

  A function that returns the document ID for the user with the given email, or
  nil if there is no such user.


  :biff.auth/single-opt-in
  ------------------------
  Default: false

  If true, the user's account will be created immediately after they submit
  their email address. Otherwise, their account will only be created after they
  verify their address by clicking the link/entering the code.


  :biff.auth/email-validator
  --------------------------
  Default:

    (fn [ctx email]
      (and email (re-matches #\".+@.+\\..+\" email)))

  A predicate function that checks if a given email address is valid. For extra
  protection, you can supply a function that calls out to an email validation
  API, like Mailgun's.


  ROUTES
  ======

  All routes that are protected by Recaptcha take a required
  g-recaptcha-response form parameter, which should be set automatically by the
  Recaptcha client library.


  POST /auth/send-link
  --------------------

  Sends a signin link to the user's email address. The link goes to
  /auth/verify-link/:token.

  Form parameters:
   - email:    The user's email address.
   - on-error: A path to redirect to in case of error. Default /.

  Redirects:
   - /sent-link?email={email}:       Success.
   - {on-error}?error=recaptcha:     The recaptcha test failed.
   - {on-error}?error=invalid-email: The :biff.auth/email-validator function
                                     returned false.
   - {on-error}?error=send-failed:   The :biff/send-email function returned
                                     false.

  Protected by Recaptcha.


  GET /auth/verify-link/:token
  ----------------------------

  A link to this endpoint is generated and sent to the user by the
  /auth/send-link endpoint. On success, assigns the :uid parameter in the
  user's session to their user ID. If the user doesn't exist yet, creates a new
  account.

  Path parameters:
   - token: A JWT generated by the /auth/send-link endpoint. Expires after one
            hour.

  Redirects:
   - {:biff.auth/app-path}:          Success.
   - {:biff.auth/invalid-link-path}: The token was invalid or expired.
   - /verify-link?token={token}:     The user needs to provide their email
                                     address again so we can ensure it matches
                                     the address contained in the token.


  POST /auth/verify-link
  ----------------------

  Verifies that the user's email address matches one contained in the token. On
  success, assigns the :uid parameter in the user's session to their user ID.
  If the user doesn't exist yet, creates a new account.

  Form parameters:
   - token: A JWT generated by the /auth/send-link endpoint. Expires after one
            hour.
   - email: The user's email address.

  Redirects:
   - {:biff.auth/app-path}
     Success.

   - {:biff.auth/invalid-link-path}
     The token was invalid or expired.

   - /verify-link?token={token}&error=incorrect-email
     The email address provided didn't match the one in the token.


  POST /auth/send-code
  --------------------

  Sends a six-digit (numeric) signin code to the user's email address. The code
  expires after three minutes or three failed verification attempts.

  Form parameters:
   - email:    The user's email address.
   - on-error: A path to redirect to in case of error. Default /.

  Redirects:
   - /verify-code?email={email}:     Success.
   - {on-error}?error=recaptcha:     The recaptcha test failed.
   - {on-error}?error=invalid-email: The :biff.auth/email-validator function
                                     returned false.
   - {on-error}?error=send-failed:   The :biff/send-email function returned
                                     false.

  Protected by Recaptcha.


  POST /auth/verify-code
  ----------------------

  Verifies that the code provided by the user matches the one they were sent.
  On success, assigns the :uid parameter in the user's session to their user
  ID.

  Form parameters:
   - email: The user's email address.
   - code:  A six-digit code.

  Redirects:
   - {:biff.auth/app-path}
     Success.

   - /verify-code?error=invalid-code&email={email}
     The given code was incorrect or expired.
